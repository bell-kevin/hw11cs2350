        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and
            models
            that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. It has applications in
            various fields, including healthcare, finance, and natural language processing.</p>

        <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning can be categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and
            reinforcement learning. Each type has its own set of techniques and use cases. In <strong>supervised
                learning</strong>, the
            algorithm is provided with a labeled dataset, meaning that each input data point is associated with a
            corresponding output or target label. The primary goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from the
            input data to the output labels, enabling the algorithm to make predictions or classifications on new,
            unseen
            data accurately. This type of learning is akin to a teacher supervising the learning process, providing
            guidance
            and feedback. Supervised learning finds application in numerous domains, including image and speech
            recognition,
            natural language processing, and predictive modeling, such as predicting stock prices or diagnosing medical
            conditions. <strong>Unsupervised learning</strong>, in contrast, operates on unlabeled data, where the
            algorithm's
            objective is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings within the data without prior knowledge
            of
            what these patterns might be. It is a form of learning that thrives on uncovering the inherent organization
            within data autonomously. Unsupervised learning techniques include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and
            generative modeling. Practical applications of unsupervised learning span diverse fields, from customer
            segmentation and anomaly detection in data security to recommendation systems and exploratory data analysis.
            <strong>Reinforcement learning</strong> takes a fundamentally different approach from supervised and
            unsupervised
            learning. It is
            a type of learning that revolves around decision-making in dynamic environments. In
            reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment and learns through trial and error, receiving
            rewards or penalties based on its actions. The agent's objective is to maximize cumulative rewards over time
            by
            discovering optimal strategies or policies. This type of learning is often likened to training a pet or
            teaching
            a computer program to play games autonomously. Reinforcement learning is prevalent in robotics, autonomous
            systems, gaming, and optimization problems, where the agent must learn how to make sequences of decisions to
            achieve specific goals.

        <h2>Benefits of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>Machine learning has revolutionized industries by automating tasks, improving decision-making processes, and
            uncovering valuable insights from large datasets. It has the potential to drive innovation and solve complex
            problems.</p>
