        <h2>Uploading Files to Icarus</h2>

        <p>Before we get started with how to upload something to the Icarus server, you first will need to download
            Remmina, which will be the program we use to connect to Icarus as well as to upload files to it. You can get
            to the download page for Remmina <a href="https://remmina.org/how-to-install-remmina/">here</a>. Ok, now
            that you have Remmina downloaded, install it and we can start connecting to Icarus.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Click where it says "Open Connection" in the top-left corner; this will open the window shown in the
                image below.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Change the drop-down menu at the top to SFTP.</li>
                <li>For the server, enter: icarus.cs.weber.edu</li>
                <li>Set port to: 22</li>
                <li>Set username to: first initial, last initial, and last 5 digits of your W number.</li>
                <li>Enter your password as your first name followed by "cs!"</li>
                <li>Then hit "Connect"</li>
            </ul>
            <p><img src="resources/example-image1.png" alt="Example image of how to connect to the Icarus server"></p>
            <li>After you try to connect to the Icarus server, you may get the pop-up message shown below. If you get
                this message, just choose "Allow".</li>
            <p><img src="resources/example-image2.png" alt="Image of a pop-up"></p>
            <li>Now you are free to upload your files and folders to Icarus where it can be publicly accessed. This is
                very easy to do with Cyberduck, all you simply need to do is select whichever files and/or folders you
                wish to upload and then just click and drag them to wherever inside of the "public_html" folder you wish
                to put them. This is shown in the image below.</li>
            <p><img src="resources/example-image3.png" alt="Image of files being uploaded to the Icarus server"></p>
        </ol>

        <p>Congratulations! You have now successfully connected and uploaded files to the Icarus server. Next, we will
            look at how to know what the URL would be for navigating to whatever you uploaded from any device connected
            to the internet.</p>

        <h2>Making a URL for a File on Icarus</h2>

        <p>To build the URL for a file on Icarus, follow this pattern, the words that are in all caps are to be replaced
            by you: "https://HOSTNAME/~USERNAME/PATH/FILENAME". For this example, we will be using icarus.cs.weber.edu
            as the hostname and gs35549 for the username. The path is the path through whichever folders you need to go
            through starting from inside of the folder public_html. One important thing to remember though is if you are
            making a URL to an index.html page, then you do not need to add the filename to the URL and you can end the
            URL with the folder name; it will automatically open index.html if it finds one in the folder. Below are
            some examples of this.</p>

        <h3>Example URL for Page on the Icarus Server</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><a
                    href="https://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~kb24850/hw2cs2350/machineLearning/machineLearning.html">https://icarus.cs.weber.edu/~kb24850/hw2cs2350/machineLearning/machineLearning.html</a>
                <br> <br> <img src="resources/example-image4.png" alt="Machine Learning"></li> <br>
            <img src="resources/example-image5.png" alt="Image of URL path for distractions page"><br>
            <br> <img src="resources/example-image6.png" alt="Image of URL path for home page">
        </ul>
